% \section*{Critique Instructions}

% You should have received an email from the STAs with an anonymous proposal from another team.

% Please read the other team's proposal, and analyze it to list at least 5 socially-responsible computing concerns.

% These could be direct responses to their answers to the SRC prompts, new aspects that you think the team missed, or something else. Each concern should be described in 1-2 sentences.

% For each additional reasonable concern expressed beyond 5, you will earn +0.5 extra credit points on your final project grade [up to 5 points total].

\section*{Critique}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item This technology could potentially be used to identify people, which could be problematic if it is done without consent.
    \item Autonomous navigation could make stalking much more accessible by allowing a stalker to program a robot to quietly follow someone around without any manual intervention.
    \item If used for a self-driving car, it might be challenging to assign blame in the event of a crash. Would the programmers or the car manufacturers be responsible?
    \item Applying these models to publicly available satellite data could allow high-resolution maps to be created of residential areas. While databases like OpenStreetMap already have this to some extent, there are massive privacy concerns with scaling this information up to every household, and potentially adding in data about number of floors and windows.
    \item This technology could be biased to work better for recognizing certain objects, including people, compared to others. For example, if there were more white people compared to Black people in the dataset used to train the technology, it might perform better at recognizing white people.
    \item If this technology were used to help workers identify objects and the tehcnology incorrectly identified something that could cause problems. Say this technology was used in the food service industry to identify different types nuts and the customer were allergic to peanuts and the technology was incorrect then that could have potentially bad consequences. 
    \item If this technology were used in a store to identify if people were stealing by scanning objects in their hands and the model incorrectly identified the object that could cause undue stress for shoppers. 
    \item State the criticism. Justify the criticism.
    \item State the criticism. Justify the criticism.
    \item State the criticism. Justify the criticism.
    \item State the criticism. Justify the criticism.
