\section*{Progress Report Instructions}

Before writing your progress report, you should have met with your TA and talked through your progress.

% Feel free to use the following questions as a guideline for writing this report:
%
\textit{Restate the goal of the project succinctly.}\\
The goal of the project is to anonymize people's faces by replacing their face with one from a dataset of computer generated faces.
%
% What has the team collectively accomplished?
%
\textit{What individual tasks have been accomplished?}\\
A: Trained VVG model on gender classification dataset to achieve 94\% accuracy, checked results with Tensorboard.\\
C: Finished faceswap step that takes the face of one person and places it on the head of another\\
J: Started work on algorithm to identify whether a face is showing teeth or not.

%
\textit{What are the current tasks?}\\
A: Running the randomly generated faces dataset through the VVG model and storing classifications in a JSON file.\\
C: Finish cleaning up the code for the faceswap, work on finding a new model to more accurately detect angles and skin tones.\\
J: Finish teeth detection, hook the face swapping code up to the frontend.

%
% What tasks remain undefined?
%
\textit{What are the next steps?}\\
One next step is to finish running the dataset of randomly generated faces through the trained VVG model to classify each face by gender and store this information in a JSON file. We will also store information about whether a face is smiling with teeth or not in this JSON file. This will allow us to eventually choose the best randomly generated face to anonymize someone's face.
